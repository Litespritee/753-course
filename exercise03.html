              Let us get to know a lil more about MISTER CAT...
            </header>
            <paragraph> 
         Mr. Cat has a first name but he keeps it secret so fairies can't magic him away or trick him into deals.  
         Mister Cat is exceptional at all things business; as all cats must be if they want more treats.

               These are Mister Cat's business purrters. When a big deal goes down you're likely to find the three of them enjoying a nice catnip cocktail afterhours.
