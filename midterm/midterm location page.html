  <ul>
     Why do we have a limit on how many books you can purchase at a time?
  <li>
    We put this limit on Saturdays due to the number of visitors. We want everyone to be able to look around and find something special. This limit allows everyone time and space to find something.

    </ul>
    <ul>
    How do tickets work?
  <li>
    The ticketing system is only implemented on Saturdays. Each person in line for the Main Room receives two time based tickets allowing them to free roam the sale while waiting for their turn in the Main Room. If you miss your ticket time you will have to rejoin the line, please allow yourself to get back to the Main Room a few minutes before your assigned time.
